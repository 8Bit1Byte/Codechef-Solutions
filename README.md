# Codechef-Solutions
Basically here we can see solution of online judge codechef solutions

It includes solutions to both practice and contest problems from:

- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)


This repository is personal, made public in the hope that someone may find it useful, but:
- Solutions may be broken or not work for you.
- Solutions may be illegible.
- Solutions may not be best in algorithmic complexity terms.
- Solutions may have been written in a rush during a contest and may not make any sense.

So, in summary, if a solution seems stupid, it probably is. I do not offer support for these solutions. I'm not interested in fixes to existing solutions or new solutions, feel free to fork / create your own if you want to share better / other solutions.
